# Advanced settings

In the advanced settings, you can configure more advanced settings for those who want to perform more detailed simulations.

## Body builder

The Body Builder function allows you to precisely define the simulated human body based on parameters such as height, weight, age, gender, body fat percentage, and skin color. Default values are already provided, but you can adjust the parameters to suit your needs.&#x20;

## Personal Comfort System (PCS)

In the Personal Comfort System (PCS) section, you can define the changes in the thermal environment created by each PCS manually. Default values are already provided. For example, the values below indicate that a desk fan creates an airflow velocity of 0.7 m/s around the head and 0.2 m/s around the chest as a default.
