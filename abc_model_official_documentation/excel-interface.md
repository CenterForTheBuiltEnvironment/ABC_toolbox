# Excel interface

## Overview

This Excel workbook has been designed to integrate the ABC model directly into Excel. One of its key advantages is that it allows users to easily input thermal environmental conditions (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity) for different body segments across multiple time steps. While the same functionality is available through the web interface, the Excel workbook offers a more user-friendly alternative.

We understand that some researchers may prefer to evaluate thermal comfort and physiological responses using their own environmental measurement data, and we hope this workbook proves to be a valuable tool for that purpose.
