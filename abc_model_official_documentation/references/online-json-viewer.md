# Online JSON Viewer

If you want to look at a JSON file in detail, we recommend copying the JSON input/output schema file and pasting it to [Online JSON Viewer](https://jsonviewer.stack.hu/).&#x20;

Here is one of the online JSON viewers.&#x20;

This online tool lets you see a JSON file more easily and helps you understand its data structure. Below is a screen capture of the input JSON schema viewed by the Online JSON Viewer. You can see, for example, that there is a "bodybuilder" object in the file, and it has some properties representing the simulated body, such as "age," "body\_fat," and "sex."&#x20;
