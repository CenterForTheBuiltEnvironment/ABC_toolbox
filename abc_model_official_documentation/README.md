# Advanced Berkeley Comfort (ABC) model

The Advanced Berkeley Comfort (ABC) model, originally developed by the Building Sciences Group at UCB for the evaluation of human comfort in automobiles, is one of the most sophisticated thermal comfort models in existence. The comfort models for local body parts and body overall are based on intensive human subject tests carried out at CBE environmental chamber. So far, these are the only models available which predict comfort for local body parts, therefore a good model to predict comfort under non-uniform environments.&#x20;

## Let's get started

Let's quickly dive into and explore the live deployment of our current web interface for the ABC model. For additional information about the web interface, [here](documentation/web-interface/) is the documentation for the web interface.

## Run the model in your favorite programming language

We offer an official API (ABC model API) with example code written in several popular programming languages and recommend using this API for those who want to run the model programmatically for advanced simulations beyond the capabilities of the web interface. You can also create powerful, custom integrations that enhance your own applications by leveraging our model's capabilities.

## Fundings

Over the decades, this work has been supported by many different funding sources in many different ways. It is difficult to name all the sponsors here, but we thank all funding support.

## Conflict of interests

The Center for the Built Environment (CBE) at the University of California, Berkeley, with which some of the authors are affiliated, is advised and funded, in part, by many partners that represent a diversity of organizations from the building industry, including manufacturers, building owners, facility managers, contractors, architects, engineers, government agencies, and utilities.
