<details>

<summary>What is the ABC model?</summary>

The Advanced Berkeley Comfort (ABC) model, developed by the Building Sciences Group at UC Berkeley, is a sophisticated thermal comfort model initially designed for evaluating human comfort in automobiles. It uniquely predicts thermal sensation and comfort for local body parts as well as the overall body.&#x20;

The model integrates a physiological model to calculate skin and core temperatures and a comfort model to predict thermal comfort levels based on skin temperature. Unlike simpler models like PMV and 2-node models, the ABC model accounts for non-uniform and transient conditions by dividing the body into 16 segments and incorporating detailed blood flow and thermoregulatory functions. This allows for more accurate comfort predictions, especially in environments with rapidly changing or uneven temperatures.

<summary>How can I use the ABC model?</summary>

**Web interface**: We provide a web interface to use the ABC model easily. Please visit [the live deployment of our current web interface for the ABC model](https://clownfish-app-wxmgi.ondigitalocean.app/). For your reference, please see the documentation [here](../documentation/web-interface/).

**ABC model API**: We offer an official API ([ABC model API](../#run-the-model-in-your-favorite-programming-language)) with example code written in several popular programming languages and recommend using this API for those who want to run the model programmatically for advanced simulations beyond the capabilities of the web interface. If you do not know about what an API is, please visit [this page](../documentation/abc-model-api/#what-is-an-api).&#x20;
